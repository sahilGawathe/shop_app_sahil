 B) REST Controller:
Handles HTTP requests in Spring Boot, enabling RESTful web services using the @RestController annotation.

 C) Database Configuration:
Configures relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) by setting data source properties in application.properties instead of using an in-memory database.

 D) Annotation-Based Configuration:
Uses annotations like @Configuration and @Bean for configuration, replacing XML for cleaner and more readable code.
